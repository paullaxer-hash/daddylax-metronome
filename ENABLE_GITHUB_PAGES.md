# Enable GitHub Pages - Step by Step

## The Problem
You're getting a 404 error because GitHub Pages isn't enabled yet.

## Solution: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository settings:**
   - Open: https://github.com/paullaxer-hash/daddylax-metronome/settings/pages

2. **Under "Source" section:**
   - Select: **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - Branch: **`main`**
   - Folder: **`/ (root)`** (the root directory)

3. **Click "Save"**

4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for GitHub to build and deploy your site

5. **Your app will be live at:**
   - **https://paullaxer-hash.github.io/daddylax-metronome/**

## Verify It's Working

After enabling, you should see:
- A green checkmark next to "Your site is live at..."
- The URL displayed in the settings page

## Install on Your Phone

Once the site is live:

**iPhone (Safari):**
1. Open Safari
2. Go to: https://paullaxer-hash.github.io/daddylax-metronome/
3. Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
4. Tap "Add to Home Screen"
5. Tap "Add"

**Android (Chrome):**
1. Open Chrome
2. Go to: https://paullaxer-hash.github.io/daddylax-metronome/
3. Tap Menu (three dots)
4. Tap "Install app" or "Add to Home screen"

## Troubleshooting

If you still get a 404:
- Make sure you selected the `main` branch
- Make sure you selected `/ (root)` as the folder
- Wait a few more minutes and try again
- Check that your repository is public (not private)
